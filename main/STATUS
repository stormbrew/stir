This file documents the status of the various components of the standard library and Technical Report. This should not be taken as a fine grained analysis, as for example <map> is much more complex than <stdexcept>.

Brackets indicate Library Technical Report extensions.
They can be gotten at http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2003/n(num).html where (num) is the number of the draft. The list is derived from http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2003/n1475.html

<new>                   (left to compiler)

(N1403)<tuple>          not done. Just needs comparison operators and extractors (but inserters are there)
(N1424)<type_traits>    done. Some traits may be incorrect or too simple
(N1424)<type_transform> done.
(N1424)<type_compare>   done.
