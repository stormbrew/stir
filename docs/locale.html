  When your users' language matches your own, it is not hard to make your
programs use it correctly in menus, dates, messages, and sorted lists.  
Software travels, though, and these days you and most potential users 
of your code may have only a machine language in common.  The market 
for your code becomes immensely larger if it can accommodate their needs,
too.

<p>
  The description of where your program is running, and of your user's 
preferences, is called its <em>locale</em>.  Keeping the locale separate 
from the program code so that it can be changed easily is called 
<em>internationalization</em>.  In C the locale describes only what 
is common to an entire country, but the C++ locale is more flexible.

<h3>Challenges</h3>

<p>
  In supporting internationalization, the C++ Standard Library
confronts many challenges.  Your server programs may have            
many clients around the world, so the standard library must
support more than one locale per program.  You use (or will soon use)
multi-threading, so it must be re-entrant.  The ways your users'    
cultures and preferences differ are unlimited, so it must be    
extensible.  Because you may not (yet) care about locales, it must
be ignorable.  Finally, because it is standard, it must be   
efficient, easy, and safe to use.

<p>
  The answer in the Standard C++ library to all these requirements uses 
the full power of the language, including new standard features not yet 
implemented in all compilers.  This article suggests how the C++ locale 
library may be used.  It also shows how it might be implemented, so you 
can use the same techniques in your own programs.
<p>

<h3>The Locale Object</h3>

<p>
  A locale in the C (not C++) standard describes a character encoding 
(with sorting rules) and the formats for a few value types: numbers, 
dates, money.  These represent only the edge of a vast continent of 
real cultural and personal choices; others commonly expressed 
include time zone, measurement system, paper size, window colors and 
fonts, citizenship, letterhead, e-mail address, sex, and shoe size.  
No standard or standards can list all your preferences.  The C++ 
standard only provides (as examples) those categories found in the 
traditional C locale libraries--but you can extend it.

<p>
  The key to understanding the C++ locale library is the <em>facet</em>.  
A facet, informally, is a class interface for a service that may be 
obtained from a locale object.  For example, the Standard C++ library 
facet <tt>num_put&lt;&gt;</tt> formats numeric values, and 
<tt>collate&lt;&gt;</tt> provides an ordering for string values.  
A facet is also an object contained in a locale.  Each locale 
object contains a set of facet objects to provide these services.

<p>
  The C++ locale is a simple object that can be (efficiently) passed 
around, copied, and assigned just like any built-in value.  Functions 
that take a locale argument can declare a default argument value, 
<tt>locale()</tt>, which is a copy of the current global locale; 
this allows you to omit the argument and get reasonable behavior.  
Each iostream instance keeps a locale object on hand, for use by the 
operators &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;.  These measures give the locale 
facilities a low profile so they won't intrude where their more 
powerful features are not needed.
<p>

<h3>A Date Class Example</h3>

<p>
  How does this look, in code?  Example 1 is a simple Date class.

<p>
<hr>
<h4>Example 1: A simple Date class</h4>

<pre>

  // file: date.h
  #include &lt;iosfwd&gt; // for istream, ostream
  #include &lt;ctime&gt;  // for struct tm

  namespace ChronLib {
  class Date {
    long day;  // days since 1752-09-14
   public:
    enum Month { jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, 
                 jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec };
  
    Date(int year, Month month, int day);
    void asCLibTime(struct std::tm*) const;  
  };

  std::ostream&amp;
  operator&lt;&lt; (std::ostream&amp; os, Date const&amp; date);

  std::istream&amp;
  operator&gt;&gt; (std::istream&amp; is, Date&amp; date);
  }

</pre>
<hr>

<p>
Don't let the "std::" namespace notation throw you; all the library 
components of Standard C++ are members of the namespace <tt>std</tt>.  
The new standard headers &lt;iosfwd&gt; and &lt;ctime&gt; declare the 
standard names used in the example, and the "::" notation gives access 
to those members. 

<p>
  Nothing about locales or facets is visible here; just a 
constructor, stream operators, and a single member function, 
<tt>asCLibTime()</tt>, which fills a Standard C library 
<tt>struct tm</tt> for communication with other libraries.   
(See your <tt>strftime()</tt> manual page for more information 
about <tt>struct tm</tt>.)  Thus, you don't need to know anything 
about locales to be able to use class Date.

<p>
  The formats your users expect to see for dates vary all over the 
map.  If you coded a format into operators &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;, you 
would leave most of your potential users dissatisfied.  Instead, when 
you write those operators, you can delegate the formatting to the 
locale object kept by the stream.  This will be demonstrated in 
example 3.

<p>
<h3>An Example Program</h3>

<p>
  How can your users control the format produced by an operator&lt;&lt; 
that uses locales?  Example 2 may be the simplest possible example.

<p>
<hr>
<h4>Example 2: A program that uses your preferred locale</h4>
<pre>

  #include &lt;iostream&gt;  /* for cout */
  #include &lt;locale&gt;    /* for locale */
  #include "date.h" 
  
  int main()
  {
    using namespace std; 
    using ChronLib::Date;
    cout.imbue( locale("") );
    cout &lt;&lt; Date(1942, Date::dec, 7) &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
  }

</pre>

<hr>
<p>
The new standard headers, &lt;iostream&gt; and &lt;locale&gt;, 
declare the names <tt>std::locale</tt>, <tt>std::cout</tt>, and 
<tt>std::endl</tt>, used here, and "date.h" has the declarations 
from Example 1.  The line that begins with "using" lets you leave 
the "std::" off standard names used later in the function.  

<p>
  The constructor call <tt>locale("")</tt> creates a locale object 
that represents the user's preferences.  The standard doesn't say what 
this means, but on many systems the library substitutes whatever is 
found in an environment variable (often LANG or LC_ALL) in place of 
the empty string.  A common name for the American locale, for example, 
is "en_US".  (On POSIX systems you can type "locale -a" to list the 
names of supported locales.)

<p>
  The call to <tt>cout.imbue()</tt> installs the newly constructed 
locale in the ostream <tt>cout</tt>, for use by the various 
operators &lt;&lt;.  
The next line uses Date's operator&lt;&lt; (declared in Example 1) which 
delegates the work to a facet of the locale that it obtains from <tt>cout</tt>.

<p>
<h3>Using Facets</h3>

<p>
  To use a facet of a locale, you call the Standard C++ library 
global function template <tt>use_facet&lt;&gt;()</tt>, found in the 
standard header &lt;locale&gt;.  Figure 1 shows its declaration.

<p>
<hr>
<h4>Figure 1: The standard template use_facet&lt;&gt;()</h4>

<pre>

  namespace std {
    template &lt;class Facet&gt;
      Facet const&amp;  use_facet(locale const&amp; loc);
  };

</pre>

<p>  
<hr>

<p>
For a facet class <tt>Stats</tt> with a member function <tt>shoeSize()</tt>, 
for example, and a locale object named <tt>loc</tt>, a call would look 
like:

<pre>
  use_facet&lt;Stats&gt;(loc).shoeSize();
</pre>

<p>
  This syntax for calling a function template, where you supply the 
template parameter explicitly instead of the compiler deducing it 
from one of the arguments, is not implemented in all compilers 
yet; it is called "explicit template function qualification".
It resembles the syntax for the new cast expressions, such as 
<tt>dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;</tt>, and in fact 
<tt>use_facet&lt;&gt;()</tt> acts 
as a safe cast.  In the example above, the resulting reference is 
used immediately to call the member function <tt>Stats::shoeSize()</tt> 
on the instance of <tt>Stats</tt> stored in the locale object <tt>loc</tt>.

<p>
<h3>An Example operator&lt;&lt;</h3>

<p>
  Example 3 is a complete implementation of <tt>Date::operator&lt;&lt;</tt>.
It uses the standard facet <tt>time_put&lt;char&gt;</tt>.

<p>
<hr>
<h4>Example 3: Operator&lt;&lt; for class Date</h4>

<pre>

  // date_insert.C
  #include &lt;ctime&gt;    /* for struct tm */
  #include &lt;ostream&gt;  /* for ostream */
  #include &lt;locale&gt;
  #include "date.h" 

  namespace ChronLib {
  std::ostream&amp;
  operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; os, Date const&amp; date)
  {
    using namespace std;
    ostream::sentry  cerberus(os);                 //1
    if (!bool(cerberus)) return os;                //2
    struct tm tmbuf; date.asCLibTm(&amp;tmbuf);        //3
    time_put&lt;char&gt; const&amp;  timeFacet = 
      use_facet&lt; time_put&lt;char&gt; &gt;( os.getloc() );  //4
    if (timeFacet.put(
          os,os,os.fill(),&amp;tmbuf,'x').failed())    //5
      os.setstate(os.badbit);
    return os;                                     //6
  }
  }

</pre>

<hr>

<p>
A lot is going on here.  The lines marked //1 and //2 create and 
check a standard "ostream::sentry" object.  (This is a new class
in the standard iostream library; its constructor prepares the 
ostream for output.  In a multi-threaded environment it might 
lock the stream.)  Line //3 fills in the local struct variable 
<tt>tmbuf</tt> with the components of the date argument.

<p>
The interesting part follows: In line //4, <tt>os.getloc()</tt> 
obtains the locale object kept by the ostream argument <tt>os</tt>, 
and the call to <tt>use_facet&lt;&gt;()</tt> gets a reference to the 
standard facet <tt>time_put&lt;char&gt;</tt> in that locale.  In line 
//5, the call to <tt>time_put&lt;char&gt;::put</tt> actually writes the 
characters out to the stream <tt>os</tt> and returns a value to report 
any errors.  (Ignore the arguments to <tt>put</tt>, for now.)  Line 
//6 destroys the <tt>locale::sentry</tt> object (perhaps unlocking 
the stream) and returns the stream <tt>os</tt>.

<p>
  Reflect on what this means.  The header "date.h" didn't mention 
locales, but because of this code hidden in <tt>operator&gt;&gt;</tt>, 
a couple of lines in <tt>main()</tt> let you format dates 
appropriately for users anywhere in the world.  (Without those 
lines in <tt>main()</tt>, you get the default "C" locale behavior.)

<p>
<h3>Your Own Facet</h3>

<p>
  The standard facets are designed so you can derive from them to get 
finer control of locale behavior.  Such a derived facet inherits the 
interface of the base facet, but you can override its virtual members 
to change its behavior.

<p>
  Derivation is not the only way you can extend a locale.  You can make 
your own facet, and construct a locale to hold it.  Example 4 is the 
sample <tt>Stats</tt> facet mentioned earlier.

<p>
<hr>

<h4>Example 4: The sample Stats facet</h4>

<pre>

  // stats.h
  #include &lt;locale&gt;

  class Stats  : public std::locale::facet {
   public:
    static std::locale::id id;
  
    Stats(int ss)        : shoeSize_(ss) {}
    int shoeSize() const { return shoeSize_; }
  
   private:
    Stats(Stats&amp;);           // not defined:
    void operator=(Stats&amp;);  // not defined:
  
    int shoeSize_;
  };
  
  // stats.C
  #include "stats.h"
  std::locale::id Stats::id;
  
</pre>

<hr>
<p>

What makes the class <tt>Stats</tt> a facet?  It's derived from 
<tt>locale::facet</tt>, it has a public static member named 
<tt>id</tt> of type <tt>locale::id</tt>, and its member functions 
are declared const.  That's all.  It does not need a default 
constructor, copy constructor, or assignment operator.  (They 
are declared here so that anybody who tries to use them will get
a compiler error.)  

<p>
  A facet class instance is only useful as part of a locale.  
Example 5 shows one way to install a facet instance as part of 
a locale.

<p>
<hr>
<h4>Example 5: Using the Stats facet</h4>

<pre>

  locale  aLocale( locale(), new Stats(48) );
  int s = use_facet&lt;Stats&gt;(aLocale).shoeSize();

</pre>
<hr>

<p>
The first statement constructs a locale object named <tt>aLocale</tt> 
as a copy of the current global locale, with the addition of a newly 
created Stats facet.  (In a real program you would probably get the 
<tt>Stats</tt> constructor argument from a file.)  It uses one of the 
locale class's template constructors (see figure 5), which deduces 
the facet type from the pointer argument.  (Support for template 
constructors, as for other member templates, is a recent addition to 
the language, and is not yet implemented in all compilers.)  The locale 
takes ownership of the facet object, so that you never need to delete 
it, and its memory can't leak.  The second statement demonstrates using 
it, as in the earlier examples.  

<p>
  Facets are most useful if they are standard, so that you can use them 
without preparing, or making your users prepare, data files for every 
language.  The most useful of any new facets you invent can be published
and standardized, independently of the C++ Standard; then the data files 
for each language can be collected and posted on the internet for use by 
anyone's programs.  

<p>
<h3>Under the Hood</h3>

<p>
  How does all this work?  It can all be implemented in ordinary C++. 
You can use the same techniques in your own programs.

<p>
  First, the locale object itself is efficient to copy and assign 
because it really contains only a pointer, as in Figure 2.  

<p>
<hr>
<h4>Figure 2: Standard C++ locale implementation</h4>

<pre>

  class locale {
   public:
    class facet;
    class id;
  
   ~locale() 
      { if (imp_-&gt;refs_-- == 0) delete imp_; }
    locale() 
      : imp_(__global_imp) { ++imp_-&gt;refs_; }
    locale(locale const&amp; other)
      : imp_(other.imp_)   { ++imp_-&gt;refs_; }
    template &lt;class Facet&gt;
      locale(locale const&amp; other, Facet* f);
    explicit locale(char const* name);
    // other constructors
    locale&amp; operator=(locale const&amp; l);
  
    template &lt;class Facet&gt;
      friend Facet const&amp;  use_facet(locale const&amp;);
  
   private:
    struct imp {
      size_t refs_; 
      vector&lt;facet*&gt; facets_;
      imp(const imp&amp;);
     ~imp();
    };
    imp* imp_;
  };

</pre>
<hr>
<p>

(Only the members used in examples above are listed here.)  The only
non-const member function is assignment, so all copies can share the 
same "implementation vector", pointed to by member <tt>imp_</tt>.  The 
copy constructor copies <tt>imp_</tt> and bumps the reference count; 
the default constructor copies a pointer to a global instance, the same 
way.  (This definition uses one new language feature not mentioned yet: 
the constructor from "<tt>char const *</tt>" is declared "explicit" so 
the compiler will not use it as an implicit conversion.)

<p>
  The facet base class, <tt>locale::facet</tt>, shown in Figure 3, is
also reference-counted.

<p>
<hr>

<h4>Figure 3: locale::facet base class definition</h4>

<pre>

  class locale::facet {
    friend class locale;
    friend class locale::imp;
    size_t refs_;
   protected:
    explicit facet(int refs = 0);
    virtual ~facet();
  };

</pre>
<hr>
<p>

It has a virtual destructor so that when the count goes to zero, 
the locale can safely destroy an instance of any class derived 
from it.  (This definition depends on another recent language 
feature: a nested class can now be defined outside the containing 
class.)

<p>
  Note that the examples here follow the convention that a reference
count value of zero implies a single reference.  This gives any static 
instances an initial use count of one before any static constructors 
have been executed.  This property is often useful, though it is not 
actually used in the code presented here.

<p>
  The only tricky bit is in the class <tt>locale::id</tt>, in Figure 4.

<p>
<hr>
<h4>Figure 4: locale::id class definition</h4>

<pre>

  class locale::id {
    friend class locale;
    size_t index_;
    static size_t mark_;
  };

</pre>
<hr>
<p>

Recall that each facet type contains a static member of type 
<tt>locale::id</tt>.  Thus, there is one static instance per facet 
type.  The default constructor <tt>id()</tt> (carefully) does not 
initialize the member <tt>index_</tt>.  Because "static constructors" 
are called at times that are (for most practical purposes) random, 
they may be called after the value has already been used, so it 
is essential that initialization not depend on a constructor.
The members of each static instance are reliably set to zero by 
the program loader, and remain zero until they are set to something 
else.  When does the member <tt>index_</tt> get set?  

<p>
  Figure 5 shows the definition of the locale template constructor 
used back in Example 5.

<p>
<hr>

<h4>Figure 5: locale template constructor</h4>

<pre>

  template &lt;class Facet&gt;
    locale::locale(
      locale const&amp; other, Facet* f)
  {
    imp_ = new imp(*other.imp_);
    imp_-&gt;refs_ = 0;  // one reference
  
    size_t& index = Facet::id.index_;
    if (!index) 
      index = ++Facet::id.mark_;
    if (index &gt;= imp_-&gt;facets_.size())
      imp_-&gt;facets_.resize(index+1);
  
    ++f-&gt;facet::refs_;
    facet*&amp; fpr = imp_-&gt;facets_[index];
    if (fpr) --fpr-&gt;refs_;
    fpr = f;
  }

</pre>
<hr>
<p>

The constructor begins by copying the implementation vector from 
<tt>other</tt>, which increments all the facet reference counts.  
Then it sets <tt>Facet::id.index_</tt> to assign the facet an identity
if it has none yet, and (if necessary) grows the new vector to fit.   
Finally, it installs the new facet, being careful to keep the 
reference counts right.  Thus, the <tt>id::index_</tt> member is 
zero until it is actually used, and it is considered used only when 
a locale object exists which contains the facet that owns it.  
(This code is not thread-safe; the thread-safe version would be 
a bit harder to read, but otherwise similar.)

<p>
  Notice that this template constructor, and <tt>use_facet&lt;&gt;()</tt>, 
can be instantiated only if the Facet parameter really qualifies as a 
facet in every way; otherwise, you get a compile or link error.  Hence,
the library enforces its own interface requirements.

<p>
<h3>The Function Template use_facet&lt;&gt;()</h3>

<p>
  The template <tt>use_facet</tt>, declared in Figure 1 and called in 
several of the examples, is (finally) defined in Figure 6.

<p>
<hr>

<h4>Figure 6: The Function Template use_facet&lt;&gt;()</h4>

<pre>

  template &lt;class Facet&gt;
    inline Facet const&amp; 
    use_facet(locale const&amp; loc)
  {
    size_t index = Facet::id.index_;
    locale::facet* fp;
    if (index &gt;= loc.imp_-&gt;facets_.size() ||
        (fp = loc.imp_-&gt;facets_[index]) == 0)
      throw bad_cast();
    return static_cast&lt;Facet const&amp;&gt;(*fp);
  }

</pre>
<hr>
<p>

If the facet has not yet been assigned an identity, or if no instance 
of it (or anything derived from it) is found in the argument locale, 
<tt>use_facet&lt;&gt;()</tt> throws an exception.  (The test, here, 
is tricky: 
if <tt>index</tt> is bigger than the vector, or if the pointer at offset
<tt>index</tt> is zero, then the facet is not present; the pointer at 
offset zero, corresponding to an uninitialized facet index, is always 
zero.)

<p>
  I have omitted definitions of assignment operators and destructors 
because they are not very interesting.  I also have omitted the 
definition of the locale constructor from a string (as used in 
Example 2), because it would not fit in a magazine article.
<p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
  The Standard C++ locale library offers much more than what is 
presented here.  Still, the most interesting facets are yet to 
be designed.  The C++ Standard committee is closing up shop; it 
remains for people like you, working with POSIX and <tt>ad hoc</tt> 
internet interest groups, to standardize bindings for what now clog 
the "preferences" menu of every interactive application.  Perhaps 
the most pressing need is for a standard time zone facet which can 
check the current version of a timezone database out on the internet 
(such as the "TZ" database at ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/).
